            <b><li>Rest.</b> Immediately stop the activity that caused the sprain, and avoid putting weight on the affected ankle.
</li>
            <b><li>Ice.</b> Apply an ice pack or cold compress to the injured ankle for 15-20 minutes at a time, every 1-2 hours, during the first 48 hours to reduce swelling.</li>

            <b><li>Elevate the Wound.</b> If possible, elevate the injured area above the level of the heart. This helps reduce blood flow to the area and minimizes bleeding.</li>
            <b><li>Maintain Pressure.</b> Continue applying direct pressure, even if blood soaks through the first dressing. Adding more layers without removing the initial one can be effective.</li>
 <b><li>Apply Tourniquet (if necessary).</b> As a last resort for severe bleeding that cannot be controlled by other means, consider applying a tourniquet above the wound. Ensure it is placed 2-3 inches above the injury site and is tight enough to stop bleeding but not so tight that it causes additional damage.</li>

            <b><li>Remove Tight Clothing or Jewelry.</b> If it's not stuck to the burn, gently remove any tight clothing or jewelry near the affected area before it swells.</li>
<b><li>Cover with a Clean Cloth.</b> Once the burn is cooled, cover it with a clean, non-stick bandage or cloth to protect against infection.</li>
<b><li>Do Not Pop Blisters.</b> If blisters form, do not pop them, as it increases the risk of infection. Leave them intact.</li>
<b><li>Over-the-Counter Pain Relief.</b> Consider giving over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if needed, following recommended dosages.</li>
